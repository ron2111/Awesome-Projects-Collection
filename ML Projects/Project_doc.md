<h3><b>Score Checker 📝</b></h3><hr>
I made this project for improving my accuracy while has been using random forest regressor
by passing different parameters .<br><br>
code is
easy to read and even you add more parameters and techniques in it by just having basic knowledge of python.
<br><br>
<h3>how to use score checker</h3>
<ol>
 <li>save "score checker" in your local directory (where you create your machine learning project)</li>
 <Li> import "score checker.py" as local library</li>
 <li>call function "score_model" form library</li>
 <li> pass 5 arguments i.e
  <ul>
   <li>model</li><li>x_train</li><li>x_test</li><li>y_train</li><li>y_test</li></ul>
 <li> And you get standard Mean Absolute Error as score</li>
  </ol>

<b><h3>Drowsiness Detection System</h3></b>

In Recent days most of the accidents were recorded due to drunk driving and sleepiness while driving at night and no safety ascepts were there.
By means of this project if any driver falls asleep or he / She eyes closes or gets drowsy he will be immediately alerted by an buzzer/Alarm System Using Face and Eye tracking
Hope this project see light .

<b><h3>Stock Price Prediciton Using LSTM</h3></b>

Artificial Intelligence is shaping the future of stock trading; while humans remain a big part of the trading equation, AI plays a critical role.
Made a Deep learning model, which could predict NASDAQ stock prices (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations).
The model was built using Tensorflow Sequential API :
A stacked LSTM was made with three LSTM layers, two Dropouts layers, and one final output layer.
Since our task was stock price prediction, mean squared error loss was used with ‘adam’ optimizer for gradient descent.

<b><h3>Resume Selection using Machine Learning (Naïve Bayes Classifier)</h3></b>

Build a Machine Learning Model on Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a given resume text should be flagged or not. Our training data consist of 125 resumes with 33 flagged resumes and 92 non-flagged resumes. Matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used for Data Visualization. Natural Processing Toolikt (NLTK) was used for pre-processing the written text (removing stop words and unnecesary words). Sklearn module in python was used to transform the training data to countvectorizer sparse matrix and train the Naïve Bayes Classifier
The results of the model were as follows:
1) Accuracy (Training Dataet) : 94.0 %
2) Accuracy (Test Dataet) : 84.0 %
3) Precision Score : 0.87
4) Recall Score : 0.84
Application: This project can be used for screening/shortlisting resumes in Univerities / Colleges / Companies / Schools.

<b><h3>Breast Cancer Prediction using Various Algorithms</h3></b>

This project predicts whether a patient who is suffering from breast cancer is benign or malignant. We have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier to predict this case. Comparing the accuracy of these 4 models, we can see that Logistic Regression(97.07%) and Support Vector Classifier(95.32%) has highest accuracy. Very feasible and useful application to overcome complications and know the severity of breast cancer.

<b><h3>Real Estate Price Prediction Project</h3></b>

This project predicts the price of the real estate using various machine leaning algorithms that are:
-  Linear Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor
-  Random Forest Regressor

Steps followed in this project are as :
- Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
