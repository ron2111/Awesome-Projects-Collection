# Regression-Model
This is the regression model I have made using ML algorithms.

# About the Project:
Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellation Is a machine learning classification project that will try to predict whether a booking will be cancelled or a booking will not be cancelled using machine learning based on historical data.

# Workflow:

## Importing Libraries:
      * Firstly we will import all the required libraies such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
  
## Data cleaning:
      * Then we will check the shape of data and will remove all the null values.
      
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
      * Feature Engineering
      * Binning
      * Aggregating Columns
      * Visualization
      * Insight & Conclusion

## Model Building:
      * Train Test Split
      * Using pipeline for model building- scaling for normal features and label encoder for categorical features
      *  Creating base model with few algorithm (Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest classifier, XGB Classifier)
      *  Checking evaluation matrix
      *  checking evaluation matrix on the tuned model
      *  Export the model with the best accuracy score
