## Overview

This project predicts whether a patient who is suffering from breast cancer is benign or malignant.
We have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier to predict this case. Comparing the accuracy of these 4 models, we can see that Logistic Regression(97.07%) and Support Vector Classifier(95.32%) has highest accuracy.
