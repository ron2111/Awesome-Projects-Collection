            <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus.</p>


            <p> 'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as
                '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.'</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
                example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
            <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
                like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
                develop serious illness.</p>

            <h2>Prevention of COVID-19 </h2>
            <br>
            <p>The best way to prevent infection from COVID-19 is to avoid exposure to the virus. The virus spreads
                mainly
                from person-to-person through close contact (within about 2 Gaz). When an infected person coughs,
                sneezes or talks, respiratory droplets are produced. Other people can catch COVID-19’ if they breathe in
                these droplets. In addition, people may come to be infected if they touch surfaces, such as doorknobs or
                tables on which infected droplets have landed, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. COVID-19 also
                spreads by asymptomatic people
            </p>
            <p>The basic preventive measures include simple public health measures that are to be followed to reduce
                the risk of infection with COVID-19. These measures must always be observed by all individuals

            <h2>COVID Vaccines</h2>
            <br>
            <p> Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is
                hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly
                with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. </p>

            <p>Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue
                wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding
                crowds. </p>

            <p>Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at
                risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against
                disease but also against infection and transmission.</p>
