  ### Install the module:
  ```python
  ~ pip install qrcode
  ```             
  ### Import the module:
  ```python
   import qrcode
  ```
  Using the qrcode library, we create a customizable QRcode. We'll need a link for which the QR code is to be generated before generating it in another file. Here, we need to first provide a link for which the QR is to be generated, then provide the script as data, and finally decide on the size and color of the QR, which will be generated in another file.

- Script to Organise your files to their respective folder grouped according to the file extension.

## Dots and Boxes

### Dots and Boxes is a fun and simple classic game for 2 or more players. The game starts with an empty grid of dots. Players take turns connecting two unjoined horizontally or vertically adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and must take another turn.
