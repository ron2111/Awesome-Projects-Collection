  /Operator '==' is not supported in CoffeeScript/

notes: """
  The `==` operator has no equivalent in CoffeeScript. If you use `==` in
  CoffeeScript, it will be compiled into `===`.

  As such, Js2coffee will throw a warning when `==` is used, but it will behave
  like `===`.
  
  If compatibility mode ins on (`--compat`), it will be escaped in backticks so
  to prevent any side effects.
