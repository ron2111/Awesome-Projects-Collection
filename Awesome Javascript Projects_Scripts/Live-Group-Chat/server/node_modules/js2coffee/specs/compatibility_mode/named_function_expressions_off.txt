notes: """
  Named function expressions are not supported in CoffeeScript.

  If compatibility mode is off (`--compat`), they will be treated like any
  other function expression, but may behave unexpectedly. In this example,
  the `typeof` will return `'undefined'` in CoffeeScript instead of the
  expected `'function'`.
