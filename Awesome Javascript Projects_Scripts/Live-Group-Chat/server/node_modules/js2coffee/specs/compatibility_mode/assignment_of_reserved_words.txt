  Certain keywords in CoffeeScript are not allowed. For instance, `on` is
  actually an alias for `true`.

  The CoffeeScript code `on = 2` will produce errors. As such, Js2coffee will
  throw an error if any of the CoffeeScript reserved keywords are used.

  If compatibility mode ins on (`--compat`), it will be escaped in backticks so
  to prevent any side effects.
