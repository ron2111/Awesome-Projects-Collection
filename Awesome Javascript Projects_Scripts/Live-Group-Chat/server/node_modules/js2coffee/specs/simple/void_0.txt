notes: """
  CoffeeScript doesn't support the `void` operator. However, doing `void
  (anything)` will always be identical to `void 0`, and CoffeeScript compiles
  the `undefined` keyword into `void 0`. Hence, all `void XXX` expressions will
  compile into `undefined`.

  That is: `void 100 === void 0 === undefined`.
