notes: """
  CoffeeScript allows function calls without parentheses, such as `alert
  "Hello"`. With this, you can do strange constructions such as `push new
  Sidebar $ "left"` (that is: `push(new Sidebar($("#left")))`).

  This is unreadable, however. Ruby has the same constructions, but Ruby
  styleguides often advocate *not* omitting parentheses unless the call
  expression is a statement.

  Js2coffee takes the same convention into consideration.
