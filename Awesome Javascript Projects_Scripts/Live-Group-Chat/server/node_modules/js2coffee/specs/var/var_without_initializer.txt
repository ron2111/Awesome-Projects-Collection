notes: """
  Doing `var a` in JavaScript will declare that the current
  function scope has a variable `a` in it, preventing things like `alert(a)`
  from getting the global `a`.

  CoffeeScript has no such construct as `var`. However, since JavaScript
  initializes all variables as `undefined`, doing an assignment to undefined
  (`a = undefined`) will yield the same result.
