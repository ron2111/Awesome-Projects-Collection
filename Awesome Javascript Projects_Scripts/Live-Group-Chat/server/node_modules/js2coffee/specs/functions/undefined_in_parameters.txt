notes: """
  Some libraries shield against the JavaScript flaw of `undefined` being
  possible to redefine by using a function wrapper that includes an
  `undefined` parameter.

  CoffeeScript will throw an error when one of the functions have `undefined`
  as its parameters (eg, `(undefined) ->`). Js2coffee will simply strip it out
  of the parameter list.

  This is not accounted for in js2coffee 0.x.
