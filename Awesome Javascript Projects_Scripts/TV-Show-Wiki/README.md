This is a simple javascript project that uses an API to search up for tv shows that get searched up usung search bar.
The following details get displayed when one searches a tv show:
-Name of the show
-Start Date and End dates of the show
-Status - whether ongoing
-Country of origin
-Network

If the show isn't available in the API then an error would show up
